DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------
ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00002.001
Name: Single aspirated air temperature
"Description: Air temperature, available as one- and thirty-minute averages of 1 Hz observations. Observations are made by sensors located at multiple heights on the tower infrastructure and by sensors located on the aquatic meteorological station. Temperature observations are made using platinum resistance thermometers, which are housed in a fan aspirated shield to reduce radiative bias."
NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Instrument System
"Abstract: Single aspirated air temperature measurements, available as one- and thirty-minute averages of 1 Hz observations. Temperature is one of the most fundamental physical measurements.  It is a primary driving factor for countless physical, chemical, and biological processes. The single aspirated sensor assembly comprises an individual Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT) housed within an"
Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.
Brief Design Description: Multiple Single Aspirated Air Temperature (SAAT) assemblies are deployed at tower sites. SAAT assemblies are located on each boom arm below the top of the tower. A single SAAT assembly is deployed at aquatic sites and is located on the aquatic met station 3m above ground level.
Brief Study Area Description: These data are collected at all NEON terrestrial and aquatic sites.
"Sensor(s): Thermometrics Climate RTD 100 Î© Probe, housed within a Met One 076B fan aspirated radiation shield"
"Keywords: platinum resistance thermometers (PRT), single aspirated air temperature (SAAT), air temperature, meteolorogy, tower, met station, profile"

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------
NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via NEON's data portal or API. Please visit https://www.neonscience.org/data-formats-conventions for a full description of the naming conventions.
ISSUE LOG
---------
"This log provides a list of issues that were identified during data collection or processing, prior to publication of this data package. For a more recent log, please visit this data product's detail page at https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00002.001."
Issue Date: 2020-03-26
"Issue: Coefficients used in IS data processing to compute the uncertainty contributed by resistance or voltage readings made by the field data acquisition system (FDAS) were updated. The updated coefficients are based on a larger FDAS sample and are larger than previous estimates. Although the difference between previous uncertainty estimates and updated estimates is small, there may be periods"

Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2020-06-10
Resolution: 2019-12-11: Updated coefficients implemented in forward  processing.
Issue Date: 2020-03-26
"Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after"

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------
"Due to an implementation error affecting flow rates within the aspirated assembly, the flow quality metrics in the expanded data product have been incorrectly generated. This affects final quality flagging of the product. Archived (historic) data will be re-processed accordingly over the next six months. Data from August 17, 2017 and forward will be archived internally but not publicly released"
